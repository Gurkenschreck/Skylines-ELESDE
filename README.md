# Skylines-ELESDE
Hey there, this mod for Cities: Skylines adds some visuals to the game, currently consisting of manipulating the colors of the light. 

There are currently 5 different modes: 
-No visuals 
-Smooth fading of colors 
-Fading of colors 
-FlipSh*t / randomize the colors 
-FlipSh*tHarder / like FlipSh*t, but faster 

I am currently planning to add more visual effects in the future: 
-Effects 
-Even more effects! 

Shortcuts 
LeftAlt + D -> change the visual mode 
LeftAlt + M -> activates the debug mode / creates a log which can be seen in the console (F7) 
LeftAlt + K -> check the status of the effects
